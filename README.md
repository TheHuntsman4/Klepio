## Overview

Klepio is a web application designed to assist in diagnosing dental problems using a custom AI model. The AI model analyzes user responses to a set of questions and provides a diagnosis from a pool of 28 unique dental conditions. This project aims to streamline the process of identifying dental issues and promoting better oral health.

## Dataset

The dataset used by Klepio is a custom collection gathered over three months in collaboration with expert dental practitioners. The dataset creation involved:

- **Formulating a Comprehensive Questionnaire**: A detailed questionnaire was developed, covering various aspects of dental health to ensure a thorough analysis.
- **Research and Iteration**: Extensive research was conducted to determine the most relevant questions. The questionnaire underwent several iterations based on feedback from dental professionals, optimizing it for accuracy and effectiveness.

This collaborative effort with dental practitioners ensures that Klepio's AI model is trained on a robust dataset, providing reliable and precise diagnoses.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Diagnosis:** Utilizes a custom AI model trained on the carefully curated dataset for accurate dental problem diagnoses.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive web interface for users to answer questions and receive instant feedback.
- **Comprehensive Diagnoses:** Covers a wide range of dental conditions, ensuring a thorough evaluation.
