      description:
        "Acute gingivitis is a common form of gingivitis, which is inflammation of the gums. It is caused by a buildup of plaque on the teeth due to poor oral hygiene. Symptoms include swollen, reddened gums that may bleed easily when brushing or flossing. Treatment involves improving oral hygiene through brushing, flossing, and professional cleanings. If left untreated, gingivitis can progress to more severe periodontitis. Acute gingivitis is reversible with proper oral care",

        "Acute irreversible pulpitis is inflammation of the dental pulp that is sudden in onset and very painful. The dental pulp is the soft tissue inside each tooth containing nerves and blood vessels. Causes include extensive decay, trauma, or a cracked tooth that allows bacteria to infect the pulp. Symptoms are intense throbbing pain that lingers even after stimulus removal. It may radiate to other areas like the jaw or neck. Treatment is a root canal to remove the infected pulp and prevent further infection. Left untreated, the inflammation can spread leading to a dental abscess.",

The dental pulp shows symptoms of irreversible pulpitis like spontaneous and lingering pain.

Treatment requires professional dental cleaning for the gingivitis plus a root canal for the infected pulp. Prompt treatment is important to prevent further dental abscesses, tooth loss, and spreading infection. Maintaining diligent oral hygiene and regular dental care can prevent these acute dental conditions.",

Symptoms include sharp pain when eating or drinking something hot, cold, sweet or acidic that lingers briefly after the stimulus is removed. Treatment involves removing the cause by treating the decayed tooth or defective filling. The pulp remains vital so root canal is not needed.",

This condition requires prompt dental treatment including potent antibiotics and drainage of the abscess. Root canal treatment or extraction of the infected tooth will also be needed to remove the original source of infection. Left untreated, the infection can continue spreading deeper through tissues or into the bloodstream with dangerous complications. The swelling and pain should resolve once the tooth is treated or removed and antibiotics administered to control the infection.",
